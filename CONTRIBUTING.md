## Commits

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) which can be described like so:

```
type(scope?): subject

body?

```

[Commitlint](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) is setup to enforce this convention.

### Commitlint Rules:
- [@commitlint/config-angular](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-angular#rules): Enforces common &#8220;types&#8221; , casing, length rules etc..

Example:
```
fix(Next): Add more cat pics
Closes #123, Closes #456
```

If you would like, when making your PR, add yourself to the AUTHORS file by appending `Name <githubusername>`. Doing so will add your name to contributor details list in the [Contributing](https://github.com/dub-step/dub-step#contributing) section.
